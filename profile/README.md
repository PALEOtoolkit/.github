# PALEOtoolkit: (exo)Earth system biogeochemical models and components

The PALEO framework provides a toolkit and model coupler for constructing Earth and exo-Earth system biogeochemical models.
Model components are available as registered packages in the Julia programming language, and may be used to create standalone
process models or coupled (exo)Earth system models.

## Where to start
Tutorials and examples are in the [PALEOtutorials](https://github.com/PALEOtoolkit/PALEOtutorials.jl) repository.

## Components and model configurations
- [PALEOcopse](https://github.com/PALEOtoolkit/PALEOcopse.jl) (the COPSE biogeochemical model)
- [PALEOocean](https://github.com/PALEOtoolkit/PALEOocean.jl) (ocean model examples and Reactions)
- [PALEOsediment](https://github.com/PALEOtoolkit/PALEOsediment.jl) (sediment model examples and Reactions)
- [PALEOaqchem](https://github.com/PALEOtoolkit/PALEOaqchem.jl) (aquatic biogeochemistry including eg marine carbonate system)
- [PALEOboxes](https://github.com/PALEOtoolkit/PALEOboxes.jl) (model coupler and core Reaction catalog)
- [PALEOmodel](https://github.com/PALEOtoolkit/PALEOmodel.jl) (solvers, output and plotting for standalone models)
